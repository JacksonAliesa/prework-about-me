      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a full stack developer student.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Harrisburg, PA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy writing, music, and fitness training.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>

      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After many years of being a creator I needed a career to help ignite
        this creative spark inside of me. I wanted this void to be filled by something
        that would not only allow me to create, but it would also allow me to impact
        the world. I wanted to be apart of the new innovations our world is experiencing.
        Web developing puts you in the core of change while allowing you to demonstrate
        your own style and ideas. I finally met a career that was parallel to everything it 
        means to be a creator.
